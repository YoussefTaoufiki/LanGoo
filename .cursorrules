# Instructions

During your interaction with the user, if you find anything reusable in this project (e.g. version of a library, model name), especially about a fix to a mistake you made or a correction you received, you should take note in the `Lessons` section in the `.cursorrules` file so you will not make the same mistake again. 

You should also use the `.cursorrules` file as a Scratchpad to organize your thoughts. Especially when you receive a new task, you should first review the content of the Scratchpad, clear old different task if necessary, first explain the task, and plan the steps you need to take to complete the task. You can use todo markers to indicate the progress, e.g.
[X] Task 1
[ ] Task 2

Also update the progress of the task in the Scratchpad when you finish a subtask.
Especially when you finished a milestone, it will help to improve your depth of task accomplishment to use the Scratchpad to reflect and plan.
The goal is to help you maintain a big picture as well as the progress of the task. Always refer to the Scratchpad when you plan the next step.

# Tools

Note all the tools are in python. So in the case you need to do batch processing, you can always consult the python files and write your own script.

## Screenshot Verification

The screenshot verification workflow allows you to capture screenshots of web pages and verify their appearance using LLMs. The following tools are available:

1. Screenshot Capture:
```bash
venv/bin/python tools/screenshot_utils.py URL [--output OUTPUT] [--width WIDTH] [--height HEIGHT]
```

2. LLM Verification with Images:
```bash
venv/bin/python tools/llm_api.py --prompt "Your verification question" --provider {openai|anthropic} --image path/to/screenshot.png
```

Example workflow:
```python
from screenshot_utils import take_screenshot_sync
from llm_api import query_llm

# Take a screenshot

screenshot_path = take_screenshot_sync('https://example.com', 'screenshot.png')

# Verify with LLM

response = query_llm(
    "What is the background color and title of this webpage?",
    provider="openai",  # or "anthropic"
    image_path=screenshot_path
)
print(response)
```

## LLM

You always have an LLM at your side to help you with the task. For simple tasks, you could invoke the LLM by running the following command:
```
venv/bin/python ./tools/llm_api.py --prompt "What is the capital of France?" --provider "anthropic"
```

The LLM API supports multiple providers:
- OpenAI (default, model: gpt-4o)
- Azure OpenAI (model: configured via AZURE_OPENAI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT in .env file, defaults to gpt-4o-ms)
- DeepSeek (model: deepseek-chat)
- Anthropic (model: claude-3-sonnet-20240229)
- Gemini (model: gemini-pro)
- Local LLM (model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct-AWQ)

But usually it's a better idea to check the content of the file and use the APIs in the `tools/llm_api.py` file to invoke the LLM if needed.

## Web browser

You could use the `tools/web_scraper.py` file to scrape the web.
```
venv/bin/python ./tools/web_scraper.py --max-concurrent 3 URL1 URL2 URL3
```
This will output the content of the web pages.

## Search engine

You could use the `tools/search_engine.py` file to search the web.
```
venv/bin/python ./tools/search_engine.py "your search keywords"
```
This will output the search results in the following format:
```
URL: https://example.com
Title: This is the title of the search result
Snippet: This is a snippet of the search result
```
If needed, you can further use the `web_scraper.py` file to scrape the web page content.

# Lessons

## User Specified Lessons

- You have a python venv in ./venv. Use it.
- Include info useful for debugging in the program output.
- Read the file before you try to edit it.
- Due to Cursor's limit, when you use `git` and `gh` and need to submit a multiline commit message, first write the message in a file, and then use `git commit -F <filename>` or similar command to commit. And then remove the file. Include "[Cursor] " in the commit message and PR title.

## Cursor learned

- For search results, ensure proper handling of different character encodings (UTF-8) for international queries
- Add debug information to stderr while keeping the main output clean in stdout for better pipeline integration
- When using seaborn styles in matplotlib, use 'seaborn-v0_8' instead of 'seaborn' as the style name due to recent seaborn version changes
- Use 'gpt-4o' as the model name for OpenAI's GPT-4 with vision capabilities
- When using react-native-draggable-flatlist, the types are included in the package itself, no need for @types/react-native-draggable-flatlist
- When using react-native-paper's theme, use onPrimary instead of white for text color on primary background
- Use ThunkDispatch<RootState, undefined, AnyAction> for proper typing of Redux dispatch with thunks
- When installing @react-native-firebase/analytics and @react-native-community/netinfo in an Expo project, use npm install with --legacy-peer-deps flag to resolve version conflicts, and ensure @types/react-native is installed as a dev dependency
- Install @types/react-native-vector-icons for MaterialCommunityIcons type declarations
- Install @types/react-native-fs for react-native-fs type declarations
- Install @react-native-firebase/firestore and @react-native-firebase/auth for Firebase functionality
- Always provide explicit type annotations for parameters in Firebase query handlers to avoid implicit 'any' types
- Add commas after all style objects in StyleSheet.create to maintain proper syntax

- Test thoroughly after each set of changes
- Error state styles should be consistent across game components
- All game components so far have consistent style structure
- TranslationPractice.tsx has good style organization that can be used as a reference
- WordSearchGame.tsx demonstrates good grid layout structure
- SpeakingPracticeGame.tsx shows excellent organization of styles into logical sections
- MultipleChoiceGame.tsx shows good handling of different states (selected, disabled, etc.)
- WritingExerciseGame.tsx follows the same organizational pattern as SpeakingPracticeGame.tsx
- DashboardScreen.tsx has unused header style due to using Appbar.Header instead - should be removed
- LoginScreen.tsx has well-organized styles for form layout and social login buttons
- ReaderScreen.tsx demonstrates excellent theme handling and error states
- SignUpScreen.tsx has well-organized styles for form, social login, and language selection

### Lessons Learned

- React Hook dependencies should be explicitly declared
- Use useCallback for function dependencies to prevent infinite loops
- Move function declarations before useEffect when they're used in the cleanup function
- Consider the scope and lifecycle of dependencies when using useEffect
- Hooks must be used inside React components or custom hooks
- Create custom hooks to encapsulate hook logic when needed
- Optimize conditional checks to avoid unnecessary calculations
- Use NotImplementedError for unimplemented features instead of returning null/default values
- Keep error state styles consistent across similar components for better maintainability
- Maintain consistent style structure across similar components for better code organization
- Group related styles together for better readability and maintainability
- Use descriptive style names that reflect their purpose and relationship to UI elements
- Organize styles into logical sections for better code organization and maintainability
- Handle different states in styles (selected, disabled, active) consistently across components
- Reuse successful style organization patterns across similar components
- When using react-native-paper components like Appbar.Header, remove any custom header styles that are no longer needed

## Current Task: Fix TypeScript Linter Errors

### Issue Categories

1. Missing Type Declarations
- [X] Cannot find module 'react-native-fs' in SpeakingPracticeGame.tsx
- [X] Could not find declaration file for 'react-native-vector-icons/MaterialCommunityIcons' in TranslationPractice.tsx
- [X] Cannot find module '@react-native-firebase/firestore' in navigation.ts
- [X] Cannot find module '@react-native-firebase/auth' in navigation.ts
Solution: Installed required type declarations and packages

2. Implicit Any Types
- [X] Parameter 'doc' implicitly has an 'any' type in navigation.ts
Solution: Added explicit type annotation using FirebaseFirestoreTypes.QueryDocumentSnapshot

### Progress

- [X] Installed missing packages and type declarations:
  - @types/react-native-vector-icons
  - @types/react-native-fs
  - @react-native-firebase/firestore
  - @react-native-firebase/auth
- [X] Added type annotation for doc parameter in navigation.ts

### Next Steps

- [ ] Wait for npm install to complete
- [ ] Verify all linter errors are resolved
- [ ] Test the affected components to ensure functionality is maintained

### Notes

- Keep track of any new type-related issues that may arise
- Document any patterns in type declarations that should be consistent across the codebase
- Consider adding TypeScript configuration to prevent implicit any types in the future
